## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the prices of used cars based on various attributes like make, model, year, mileage, and more. The steps involved include:

1. Importing and exploring the raw dataset.
2. Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
3. Building and training a machine learning model.
4. Evaluating the model’s performance and making predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

- `Make`: Brand of the car.
- `Model`: Specific model of the car.
- `Year`: Manufacturing year.
- `Mileage`: Total distance the car has traveled.
- `State`: Location where the car is being sold.
- `Price`: Selling price of the car (target variable).

The raw data is available in the `data/` directory.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for analysis and modeling. The following steps were performed:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputation or removal of missing entries.
- **Data Transformation**: Converting categorical data into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Outlier Removal**: Identifying and handling outliers to prevent them from skewing the model.

## Modeling and Prediction

A machine learning model is built using the scikit-learn library. The process includes:

1. **Model Selection**: Various models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest are considered.
2. **Training and Testing**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters using Grid Search or Randomized Search to enhance accuracy.
4. **Prediction**: The final model is used to predict car prices on unseen data.

## Results and Evaluation

The model’s performance is assessed using the following metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Penalizes larger errors, giving a sense of the model’s accuracy.
- **R-squared Score**: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.

The results are visualized using plots to compare predicted prices against actual values.

## Setup and Usage
